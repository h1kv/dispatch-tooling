# DISPATCH.AI

**The canvas for agents.**

An open-source visual canvas / IDE for building, running, and shipping AI agent
workflows. Place nodes on an infinite canvas, wire them top-to-bottom, press
**Run**, and the chain executes — each node passing its output downstream.

## What is DISPATCH.AI?

Most AI tooling makes *you* the runtime: you prompt, wait, copy, paste, and
re-prompt in a loop. DISPATCH lets you lay the work out **as a graph** instead.
Each node runs a model (with tools), edges carry output and control from one
node to the next, and the whole chain runs top-to-bottom — locally, on your own
machine or self-hosted infrastructure.

It is a real-time, multiplayer canvas (collaborate over your LAN, no cloud
required), multi-provider (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, or local models — picked
per node), and human-in-the-loop (Review nodes pause for approval).

> **Status:** early and moving fast. Built in the open by a solo developer —
> see [SPONSORS.md](SPONSORS.md) for why help matters. Expect rough edges, and
> please [open issues / PRs](CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Features

- **Visual canvas** — drag nodes onto an infinite grid and wire them together.
- **Multi-provider, per node** — OpenAI / Anthropic / Google / local; hotswap
  the provider and model on any node, mid-run.
- **Live tools** — agents can call `web_search`, `fetch_url`, `read_file`,
  `write_file`, `list_files`, and `shell_exec` during a run.
- **Human-in-the-loop** — Review nodes pause the chain for Approve / Reject.
- **Branch & merge** — Parallel fan-out, Merge fan-in, and Context inputs.
- **Real-time multiplayer** — named cursors, shared state, and live editing over
  WebSockets on your local network.
- **Agentic voice control** — talk to your canvas via the VoiceOrb (OpenAI
  Realtime).
- **Inbuilt terminal** — a real CLI inside the app (`run`, `stop`, `retry`, …).
- **Self-hostable & local-first** — runs entirely on your machine; your data
  never has to leave it.

See the [roadmap](#roadmap) for what's in development.

## Quick start

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js ≥ 20** and **npm**
- At least one model-provider API key (OpenAI, Anthropic, or Google)

### One-line install

```bash
# macOS / Linux
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/h1kv/dispatch-tooling/main/scripts/install.sh | bash
```

```powershell
# Windows (PowerShell)
irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/h1kv/dispatch-tooling/main/scripts/install.ps1 | iex
```

The installer clones the repo, installs dependencies, and scaffolds your config.

### Manual install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/h1kv/dispatch-tooling.git
cd dispatch-tooling
npm install
npx dispatch init        # scaffold .env + workspace dirs
# add a provider key to .env, then:
npx dispatch doctor      # verify your environment
npx dispatch start       # http://localhost:3000
```

Open **http://localhost:3000**. The server also prints your local-network URLs
so teammates on the same network can join the same canvas.

### The `dispatch` CLI

A dependency-free CLI ships with the project (`bin/dispatch.mjs`):

| Command | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `dispatch start [--port N] [--prod]` | Start the app (dev, or a production build). |
| `dispatch init` | Scaffold `.env` + workspace dirs. |
| `dispatch workspace list` / `new <name>` | List or scaffold `.dispatch/` canvases (per worktree). |
| `dispatch doctor` | Check your environment is ready to run. |
| `dispatch version` / `dispatch help` | Version / usage. |

### npm scripts

| Command | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `npm run dev` | Start the dev server (Vite middleware + WebSocket server). |
| `npm start` | Start via the CLI (`dispatch start`). |
| `npm run build` | Build the frontend to `dist/`. |
| `npm run preview` | Serve the production build. |
| `npm test` | Run the test suite (`node --test`). |
| `npm run typecheck` | Type-check with `tsc --noEmit`. |

## Configuration

All configuration is via environment variables — see [`.env.example`](.env.example)
for the full list. The essentials:

| Variable | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `OPENAI_API_KEY` / `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` / `GOOGLE_API_KEY` | Model providers (need at least one). |
| `OPENAI_MODEL` | Default OpenAI model (e.g. `gpt-4.1`). |
| `RTM_OPENAI` | OpenAI Realtime key for agentic voice control (optional). |
| `VERCEL_TOKEN` / `VERCEL_PROJECT_ID` | For the Deploy node (optional). |
| `PORT` | Server port (default `3000`). |

```

The frontend renders the canvas and talks to the server over a WebSocket. The
server holds canvas state, runs the execution engine (which calls model
providers and tools), and broadcasts updates to all connected clients.

## Node reference

A chain is built from typed nodes wired top-to-bottom. The 13 node types:

| Node | Role |
| --- | --- |
| **Initialiser** | Entry point — sets the task + workspace + default model. |
| **Investigate** | Research with live tools (`web_search`, `fetch_url`). |
| **Plan** | Turn input into a structured roadmap. |
| **Design** | Produce a spec / architecture. |
| **Create** | Generate the artefact (code, content, drafts). |
| **Evaluate** | Critique the previous output for quality. |
| **Doc** | Produce docs, summaries, changelogs. |
| **Apply** | Apply changes to the workspace. |
| **Context** | Feed shared context into downstream nodes. |
| **Review** | Human checkpoint — pause for Approve / Reject. |
| **Parallel** | Fan a task out to run branches concurrently. |
| **Merge** | Fan-in — converge branches into one result. |
| **Deploy** | Ship the workspace (e.g. to Vercel). |

Nodes are defined in [`shared/nodeRegistry.ts`](shared/nodeRegistry.ts) and their
behaviour in [`skills/`](skills/) — they are customizable, and new ones can be
added.

## Roadmap

Actively in development / testing — see the [feature pages](https://github.com/h1kv/dispatch-tooling)
for details:

- Advanced orchestration controls (conditional routing, retries, loops, sub-canvases)
- Directive model control via a `MODELS.md` file
- Analytics — node-delegated token + cost tracking across all providers
- Git-backed canvas versioning
- Local model support (Ollama / llama.cpp / LM Studio)
- Model Prompt — generate whole node graphs from a prompt
- Subscription-model integration via MCP
- Testing-pipeline nodes, canvas planning, richer multiplayer
- A portable CLI + one-line install
